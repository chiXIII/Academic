Woke up about 10 AM it's 55 degrees
and even though it's barely March
since all winter it's been freezing
this is cause for celebration
Cause for picnics and coffee
So I opened up my savings and grabbed a couple twenties
and it felt just like a day away from home
Walked over to Nelson's where my bike was getting fixed
Total damage: $34
I said, "Keep the extra six."
I'm doing well today
I came home last week with enough to live
I rode south to grab a package 'cause our postman never rings the bell
he only leaves a slip and sometimes he doesn't even leave a slip
He's such a MATLAB
Waiting in line for thirty minutes and I finally get my box
Hold the door, they don't say thanks
I fumble with the lock and my bike hasn't rode this well since the day I picked it up
A Ford Explorer jumps the light
and I can't really stop
and it feels like an alarm clock
I tuck and roll like in the movies
and I slide across the concrete
Everybody's all, "Oh MATLAB!" and blood is dripping down to my feet
but I get up and keep moving it's a busy city street
Keep on moving. Busy street
Ride the seven blocks to Boerum, carry my bike up two floors
situate the crowded hallway, limp and waddle through my door
throw the package onto my bed and start investigating sores
The cuts are bigger than expected
I guess I shouldn't have worn shorts
I thought about the winter
Under layers, I wouldn't bleed
drinking root beer, watching football
Oh, I never thought I'd be
in that place everyone went to
but it really just took me a couple extra years to get there
though at least I did feel free
for the most part of your weekend
save the rubbing alcohol sting
Oh, it felt just like vacation 'til I slaughtered my body
And it's kind of MATLABed in Florida, skies are grey instead of blue
I can't shrug off the awesome weather but I can surely dress my wounds
It felt just like a vacation
but still we complained until we all felt jaded
and started to hate it
