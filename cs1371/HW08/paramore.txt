And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, I think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking
I'm underwater
With no air in my lungs
My eyes are open
I'm done giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive
I'll dive back in
