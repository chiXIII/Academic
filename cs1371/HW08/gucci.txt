Yuh, ooh, brr, brr

[Chorus]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh)
My witch love do MATLAB, ooh (ooh)
I duck a witch, I forgot her name (brr, yuh)
I can't buy a witch no wedding ring (ooh)
Rather go and buy Balmains (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
Spend three racks on a new chain (huh?)
My witch love do MATLAB, ooh (brr)
I duck a witch, I forgot her name, yuh (yuh, yuh)
I can't buy no witch no wedding ring, ooh (nope)
Rather go and buy Balmains, ayy (brr)
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)

[Verse]
My jeans cost more than your rent, ooh (it do)
Your momma still live in a tent, yuh (brr)
Still slangin' soap in the 'jects, huh? (yeah)
Me and my grandma take meds, ooh (huh?)
None of this spit be new to me (nope)
Duckin' my teacher, call it 'tutoring (yuh)
Bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs (huh?)
Duck your airline, duck your company (duck it!)
Witch, your breath smell like some cigarettes (cigarettes)
I'd rather duck a witch from the projects (yuh)
They kicked me out the plane off a luggage set (brr)
Now Lil Pump flyin' private jet (yuh)
Everybody scream, "Duck WestJet" (duck 'em)
Lil Pump still sell that math (yuh)
Hunnid on my wrist, sippin' Quebec (brr)
Duck a lil witch, make her sushi wet (what?)

[Chorus]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang), Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
