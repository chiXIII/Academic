And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
